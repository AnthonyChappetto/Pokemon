# add in more routes from sinnoh
# Add in shiny charm probability
# Add in other region compatibility
# Add in day night cycle odds based on computer time
# Add in individual randomly generated stats for each shiny
# Organize these shinies by most appeal in their stats
# return stats about how many of certain pokemon you found
