In the Pokemon Main Series, you run into wild pokemon whenever your player character walks into the tall grass. Pokemon are classified by generations. A generation usually refers to when:
    -An entire new batch (around 100) of newely discovered pokemon are added
    -A new game in the main series that is not a remake of an old game or a remake that expands upon a newly released game and optimises it. 
There are currently 9 generations of Pokemon games, these include:
    Generation 1: Pokemon Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow
    Generation 2: Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal
    Generation 3: Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Fire Red, Leaf Green, and Emerald
    Generation 4: Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heartgold, and Soulsilver
    Generation 5: Pokemon Black, White, Black2, and White2
    Generation 6: Pokemon X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire
    Generation 7: Pokemon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon, Let's Go Pikachu, and Let's Go Eevee
    Generation 8: Pokemon Sword, Shield, Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl, and Legends Arceus
    Generation 9: Pokemon Scarlet, Violet, and Legends ZA

    That is a lot of games.

    Shiny pokemon were introduced in Generation 2, and had a base odds of 1 in 8192. That means every time you encountered a pokemon you had a 0.00012207031 chance of it being a shiny. This does not go up the more you encounter. This encounter rate stays the same. It is related to gambling where your odds do not increase the longer you try, even if your brain is telling you that you have a "win" coming soon. However, this doesn't destroy your wallet unlike gambling. (unless you wanna buy these games physically in 2024)

    Generations 2-5 used this 1 in 8192 before becoming more user friendly in Generation 6 onwards, now having a 1 in 4096 odds. Generation 5 also introduced the shiny charm
